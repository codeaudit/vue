## What is a Pattern?

Patterns are base palettes to identify and apply common, consistent conventions across an application.

## What is a Component?

Component are reusable modules, or widgets, that are aggregated to compose an entire page or view. Each component has a distinct purpose and may have prescriptive specifications for behaviors, formats, editorial, visual style, and variable treatments.


Despite their similarities, components and patterns differ in important ways. At a high level, patterns are meant to serve as baselines open to interpretation and use; on the other hand components are quite specific to an established design and thus more prescriptive and fixed.
