## Popover

Popovers or Inline Dialogs are containers for supporting content that are displayed on user request. The container should not take over the entire page. If complex interactions are needed consider using 'xxxxx' as an alternative.

### Behaviors

* Trigger Open - Display on 'clicking' on UI component, note: not hover
* Notch - The notch position should be at the top of the popover and centered on UI component where possible. Direction of notch should point North.
* Actions - Popovers should have two actions or less. The main action should be to consume the information inside the popover and close. Alternatively the user may want to select a 'secondary button' or a 'link button' if needed.
* Trigger Close - Automatic close by 'clicking' outside the popover or 'clicking' on 'close button'.

### Variations
* 'Tooltip'
* 'xxxxx'
