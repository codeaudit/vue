## Tooltips

Tooltips are secondary helpful content that is displayed on user request. Tooltips should be plain text and be as short as possible, two sentences max. If any interactions are needed consider using 'Popover' as an alternative.

### Behaviors

* Trigger Open - Display on 'hover' on UI component, note: not click activated.
* Notch - The notch position should be at the top of the tooltip and centered on UI component where possible. Direction of notch should point North.
* Actions - Tooltips should only have one action, to quickly consume the supporting information and move on.
* Trigger Close - Automatic close by moving mouse away from tooltip container.

### Variations
